 #  Team Edge List Mini-project: THE SHOPPING LIST HELPER
 # 
 #  This project prompts users using input() to prompt users
 #  to add (or remove) items from a shopping list. It starts empty
 #  and each time the program is run it asks you to either add or 
 #  remove an item from the list. It also updates the user of its
 #  contents. The shopping list also checks to see if an item 
 #  is already present in the list and prevents you from adding it
 #  again, giving feedback along the way. 
 #
